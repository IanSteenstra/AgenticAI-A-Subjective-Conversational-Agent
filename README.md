# AgenticAI-A-Subjective-Conversational-Agent
This project explores the development of a conversational AI that exhibits a sense of agency through its own internal model of the world, including beliefs, desires, and intentions. The AI uses Bayesian inference to update its beliefs and active inference to make conversational choices.
